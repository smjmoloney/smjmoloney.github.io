		<h3>Chapter 3 - Coronation</h3>
		<p>The plane landed, giving a chance for William to access his luggage and escape the iron confinement. He would quickly notice a man holding a placard; 
		scribed was Williams name. Not understanding the conventions of private travel, he assumed that it was a police officer. Avoiding the man completely and, 
		with great swiftness, disappeared and exited the airport.</p>

		<p>Opting for an alternative, William hailed a transport vehicle. Quickly, he noticed several oddities. The license plate on the vehicle said &#147FRESH&#147 
		as two plush dice dangled from the rear-view mirror. William immediately felt uncertain. He thought that the vehicle was rare; possibly of an unsavoury 
		nature. &#147Nah, forget it&#147, he said, reassuring himself. He entered and was on his way.</p>

		<p>His initial uncertainty was confirmed. Williams instincts had tried to convince him otherwise, he thought as he felt the car careening back and forth. 
		As soon he entered the vehicle, the driver had not stopped. This was no joy-ride, he thought, upset as he was. At this moment he had never wished more to 
		be home in the loving embrace of his mother. Terror overcame him, he started to scream. The vehicle found itself whipping and thrashing; so ready to give 
		the passengers their end. And it did. William wanted so much to be a prince, but he never will.</p>

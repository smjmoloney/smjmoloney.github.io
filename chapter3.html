		<h3>Chapter 3 - Coronation</h3>
		<p>The plane landed, giving a chance for William to access his luggage and escape the iron confinement. He would quickly notice a man holding a placard; 
		scribed was Williams name. Not understanding the conventions of private travel, he assumed that it was a police officer. Avoiding the man completely and, 
		with great swiftness, disappeared and exited the airport.</p>

		<p>Opting for an alternative, William hailed a transport vehicle. Quickly, he noticed several oddities. The license plate on the vehicle said &#147FRESH&#147 
		as two plush dice dangled from the rear-view mirror. William immediately felt uncertain. He thought that the vehicle was rare; possibly of an unsavoury 
		nature. &#147Nah, forget it&#147, he said, reassuring himself. He entered and was on his way.</p>

		<p>Arriving at his and aunt and uncles homestead, William exited the vehicle and said to the driver &#147Yo, home, smell ya later&#147. His initial uncertainty 
		being confirmed by the stench. He looked on and knew that he was finally there, ready to take on the world.</p>

		<p>This is the day that William knew his life was suddenly &#147flipped-turned&#147 and &#147upside down&#147. He knew that in the small town, located in Santa Monica, 
		Los Angeles, he would be prince. The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.</p>

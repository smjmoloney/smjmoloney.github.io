		<h3>Chapter 3 - Coronation</h3>
		<p>The plane landed, giving a chance for William to access his luggage and escape the iron confinement. He would quickly notice a man holding a placard; 
		scribed was Williams name. Not understanding the conventions of private travel, he assumed that it was a police officer. Avoiding the man completely and, 
		with great swiftness, disappeared and exited the airport.</p>

		<p>Opting for an alternative, William hailed a transport vehicle. Quickly, he noticed several oddities. The license plate on the vehicle said “FRESH” 
		as two plush dice dangled from the rear-view mirror. William immediately felt uncertain. He thought that the vehicle was rare; possibly of an unsavoury 
		nature. “Nah, forget it”, he said, reassuring himself. He entered and was on his way.</p>

		<p>Arriving at his and aunt and uncles homestead, William exited the vehicle and said to the driver “Yo, home, smell ya later”. His initial uncertainty 
		being confirmed by the stench. He looked on and knew that he was finally there, ready to take on the world.</p>

		<p>This is the day that William knew his life was suddenly “flipped-turned” and “upside down”. He knew that in the small town, located in Santa Monica, 
		Los Angeles, he would be prince. The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.</p>

		<h3>Chapter 1 - Early Beginnings</h3>
		<p>William was known for being a charismatic, well-mannered, and friendly lad. He would attend school, play basketball in the local playground, jest with his 
		friends, etc. They would spend their time “chilling out” and “maxing”. Sun filled days would offer them the opportunity to relax in the great city of Philadelphia, 
		Pennsylvania where William was born and raised. Day-to-day life was perfectly normal and mundane. Unfortunately, these fun times were not to last.</p>

		<p>One day, a couple of young men that had been terrorising the neighbourhood entered the playground where William sat with his peers. Targeting poor William, 
		they would continue in his direction with great aggression. He had no intention on fighting these goons that approached, but the decision was not his to be made. 
		It all felt so fast, William had little to no memory of the confrontation. He showed no retaliation as evident by the bullies; unscathed as they were. This could 
		not be said for William as he came home bloodied and bruised. His mother, instantly scared and irate at his blatant condition did not hesitate. She had no belief 
		that William should stay within the urban environments of Philadelphia. She needed to send him away; safe from harm.</p>

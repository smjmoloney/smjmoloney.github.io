		<h3>Chapter 2 - Acceptance</h3>
		<p>William would be sent to live with his aunt and uncle located in the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains. He could live a wealthy lifestyle 
		with his cousins in the suburbs of Los Angeles, but this would not sway his opinion. Leaving his family and friends was not something he could bear. 
		William begged and pleaded with his mother to let him stay and did so for several days. Soon, his mother would put her foot down and, before he could 
		continue, pack his luggage, arrange flights, and organise stays. With a quick peck, his mother handed him his ticket and sent him on his way. Deciding 
		that there was not much that could be done, William put on his Walkman and, with a sigh, said &#147I might as well kick it&#147.</p>

		<p>For his travels, William had the opportunity to fly in first class. He exclaimed his fondness for it, drinking orange juice from a champagne glass. 
		He pondered that of his family’s lifestyle, wondering if they all experience these luxuries. He exclaimed once more, believing that he would enjoy these 
		indulgences. &#147But wait&#147, he thought, &#147I hear they’re prissy, bourgeois…&#147. William did not think he would fit in with the &#147proper&#147 and &#147upper-class&#147 crowds. 
		He reconsidered and hoped that they would simply be prepared for him.</p>
